## About Me

I am a highly skilled Data Analyst and Production Director with over half a decade of experience at Hillypine Integrated Services, specializing in the integration of data-driven insights to optimize production processes, enhance efficiency, and drive operational excellence. My dual expertise in both production management and data analysis allows me to bridge the gap between operational strategy and analytical insights, resulting in improved workflows, higher productivity, and informed decision-making.

As a Production Director, I have successfully led cross-functional teams in fast-paced environments, particularly in the restaurant industry, where I streamlined kitchen operations, maintained top-tier food safety standards, and maximized efficiency. With a strong background in statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and workflow optimization, I consistently deliver results within budget and on time.

Proficient in SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I leverage advanced analytics tools to identify opportunities for process improvements, uncover actionable insights, and elevate overall business performance. I recently obtained a certification in data analysis, further enhancing my ability to deliver data-driven solutions that align with strategic goals.

My career goal is to lead innovative projects that integrate data analytics with operational management to drive continuous improvement and set new benchmarks for productivity and quality. I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology and fostering a culture of excellence to ensure that businesses not only meet but exceed their operational targets.

I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth, applying my expertise across various industries, including health, technology, business, and marketing, to drive sustainable growth and operational success.
